// Regular expressions are most fun to solve but like i said before
// hackerrank explainations are making the problem even harder -_-

function regexVar() {
  /*
   * Declare a RegExp object variable named 're'
   * It must match ALL occurrences of numbers in a string.
   */
  const re = /[0-9]+/g;

  /*
   * Do not remove the return statement
   */
  return re;
